I've had experiences in a <i>real</i> Veterinary Center. I did my 11th grade internship at the <a href="https://www.veterinarycentersofthevi.com/">Veterinary Centers of the VI.</a> I first-handedly witnessed things
people could only dream of. For more information about the Virgin Islands Veterinary Center, you can click

      <h2 id="steps">How to become a Veterinarian</h2>
	<ol>

		if becoming a Veterinarian is really in your books.</p>
		
		<li>Complete Undergraduate Degree</li>

			additional courses, make sure you check the requirements for the shcool before applying.</p>
			
		<li>Gain Experience</li>
			Intern at your local veterinary centers, humane socieites, or any other experiences having to do with animals
		<li>Apply to Veterinary Schools</li>
			<p>Most schools ask for a personal statement, two or more recommendation letters, secondary essays, and resume.
			Each school is different, make sure to check what each school requires for application.</p>
		<li>Complete a DVM Degree</li>
			<p>Once into vet school, you need to complete a four-year Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree.
			The first two years of vet school mainly focus on science courses with labs, the third year focuses on clinical experience. 
			The final year mostly includes clinical rotations to attain hands-on experiences.</p>
		<li>Take the NAVLE</li>
			<p>Next up is The North American Veterinary Licensing Exam (NAVLE). This exam is multiple-choice and it is 
			required for every U.S. veterinary licensure. Once this exam is passed, veterinary medicine can be practiced.
		<li>Complete a Residency Program</li>

			vet school. Residency can help you obtain positions tailored to your interests and some with higher pay. You can

      <h2 id="reason2">#2: Helping the Community </h2>
	  There are many animals in the Virgin Islands; especially strays. These animals need attention and there are
	  very few veterinarians to help them. In the world as a whole there are more pets than vets. Vets help the
	  communities pets stay safe and healthy. The <a href="https://humanesocietystthomas.org/">Humane Society in St. Thomas</a>
	  harbors stray animals until they find a home. However, there are not enough workers and volunteers that add up to 
	  the amount of animals that live at the Humane Society.
	  
	  <p>By becoming a vet you can help the community as a whole. In due time this world is going to need more vets
	  because the animal population keeps growing and it does not plan on stopping.</p>
